                    <h3>Nutrition and activity tips</h3>
                    <p>
                        Here are some tips to follow:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Try to control when and where food is eaten by your children by providing regular daily meal 
                             times with social interaction and demonstration of healthy eating behaviors.</li>

                             <li>Involve children in the selection and preparation of foods and teach them to make healthy choices
                              by helping them select foods based on their nutritional value.</li>

                             <li>For children in general, reported dietary intakes of the following are low enough to be of concern 
                                 by the USDA: calcium, magnesium, potassium, and fiber. Select foods with these nutrients when possible.</li>

                             <li>Most Americans need to reduce the number of calories they consume. When it comes to weight control,
                                calories do count. Controlling portion sizes and eating nonprocessed foods helps limit calorie intake
                                and increase nutrients.</li>

                            <li>Parents are encouraged to provide recommended serving sizes for children.</li>

                            <li>Parents are encouraged to limit childrens video, television watching, and computer use to less than 2 hours
                                 daily and replace sitting activities with activities that require more movement.</li>

                            <li>Children and adolescents need at least 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity on most days for
                                maintenance of good health and fitness. This is also for healthy weight during growth.</li>

                            <li>To prevent dehydration, encourage children to drink fluid regularly during physical activity and drink several
                                glasses of water or other fluid after the physical activity is completed.</li>
                        </ul>

                   <h4> How to Help Your Toddler Learn How to Get Dressed </h4>
                    <p>Parents and caregivers often dream of those warm days during babyhood when little ones can run amok
                       in a diaper and get all those developmental benefits of naked time. But eventually, clothes happen! 
                       When toddlers learn to get dressed and undressed on their own, it helps them feel more independent.
                        Here are a few tips for helping your child master these skills. </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Start with Undressing </li>
                                    <p>Since undressing is easier for them to accomplish solo, it is a great place to start.
                                      It boosts self-confidence and may even spark their interest in learning more about the
                                       dressing process. </p>
                                <li>Practice Dressing-Related Words </li>
                                    <p>This stage is a wonderful time to practice words and phrases that are associated with getting dressed.
                                         Remember to include sequence words (first, second, last), spatial words (front, back, underneath),
                                         and label clothing elements (armholes, pant legs). This improves their vocabulary and ability to follow
                                          instructions. </p>
                                <li>Use Visuals to Guide Them </li>
                                    <p>Our brains are built to easily process visuals, so pinning up a step-by-step illustration of getting dressed
                                      can support this learning process. You can take pictures of your child going through each step or find images
                                      online. Be sure to hang them at your childs height for easy viewing. </p>
                                <li>Get Dressed Together</li>
                                    <p>Kids learn a lot through imitation, so give them plenty of opportunities to see how it works. Walk them through 
                                      each step so they can see you do it first. For instance, take your shirt, find the tag, and identify it as the back
                                       of the shirt. Then, ask them to find the tag on their shirt and point to the front and back. </p>
                                <li>Try a Larger Size </li>
                                    <p>Clothes are like puzzles for young kids, and the larger the pieces, the easier it is for them to figure out where
                                       everything goes. When practicing getting dressed, use shirts or pants that are a few sizes bigger to help them maneuver
                                      their bodies in and out of each item. </p>
                                <li>Dress While Sitting Down </li>
                                    <p>Toddlers are still learning the art of balancing, so it can be much easier for them to grasp putting on socks and shoes
                                         and finding pant legs while sitting down. </p>
                                <li>Do not Rush Through It </li>
                                    <p>Remember that dressing lessons do not have to happen every day! If you are typically in a hurry in the mornings,
                                         save it for weekends or days without a strict schedule. Watching your toddler get lost in a long-sleeve shirt
                                          can be time-consuming and frustrating for both of you. Do it at a time when you can move slowly and enjoy 
                                          practicing together. </p>
                            </ul>
